# Odin Recipes

This project is a basic recipe website built as part of the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations course.

## Project Description

The website consists of a main index page with links to several recipe pages. Each recipe page details the ingredients and steps required to make the dish. The goal of this project was to practice essential HTML skills, file management, and Git workflows without relying on CSS for styling yet.

## Recipes Included

* **Pork Sinigang** 
* **Mac and Cheese**
* **Leche Flan**

## Skills Demonstrated

* **HTML Structure:** Utilizing semantic tags (`<h1>` - `<h6>`, `<p>`, `<body>`, etc.) to create a readable document structure.
* **Links and Navigation:** creating both absolute and relative links between pages within the directory structure.
* **Lists:** Implementing unordered lists (`<ul>`) for ingredients and ordered lists (`<ol>`) for steps.
* **Media:** Embedding images using the `<img>` tag and managing attributes like `src` and `alt`.
* **Git & GitHub:** Practicing the commit workflow (`git add`, `git commit`, `git push`) to manage version control and hosting the repository.

## Future Improvements

* Add CSS to style the layout and typography.
